# Compatibility matrix

What the Nectar SDK supports, and how far each part has been verified, across ROS 2
distributions and platforms. The SDK is modular: a core install pulls ROS base, the
SDK packages, and core Python deps; everything else (control backends, AI, RealSense,
OAK-D, simulation) is an opt-in group. Each module table states how to install it.

This is a living document. Status reflects the most thorough check performed so far;
cells advance as more setups are exercised

## Legend

Each cell's symbol reflects the deepest verification tier reached (see [How it's verified](#how-its-verified)). Rows with a footnote marker carry a caveat at the bottom of the page.

| Symbol | Meaning |
|:---:|---|
| `●` | **Functional** — a `verify-functional` check, a SITL run, or a hardware run exercised it (a real operation, not just an import). |
| `◐` | **Build** — the image builds and `make verify` passes (package present, imports, nodes); the functional check has not been recorded on that distribution yet. |
| `○` | **Not yet tested**. |
| `—` | **Not applicable** (the feature or its dependency is not available there). |

ROS 2 distribution implies its Ubuntu base: **Humble** = 22.04, **Jazzy** / **Kilted** =
24.04. The **Jetson** column is JetPack 6.x (L4T, arm64, CUDA), built from
[`docker/Dockerfile.jetson`](../docker/Dockerfile.jetson) on a Humble base.

## How it's verified

Three commands back this matrix; a cell's symbol reflects the deepest tier reached. CI runs tiers 1-2 across distros/arches and the cells above are updated by hand from those results.

| Tier | Command | What it proves |
|------|---------|----------------|
| 1 — Build | `make verify` | The image builds, packages are present, modules import, and node executables are installed. (`make doctor` gives a read-only environment/device/CUDA report.) |
| 2 — Functional | `make verify-functional` | The **pytest** suite under [`nectar/test/`](../nectar/test) (also run by `colcon test`). Each test performs a *real operation* — detect a synthetic ArUco marker, run a PID step response, complete a MAVLink handshake over loopback, relay a VSLAM pose, open the Qt window offscreen, run a nano-model inference. Tests self-skip when a device/GPU/sim/dependency is absent. Subset with `MODULE="vision control"`; hardware/GPU tests opt in via `make verify-hardware`; reproduce per-distro with `make ci-local`. |
| 3 — SITL / integration | `make verify-sitl` | The suite under [`nectar/test/sitl/`](../nectar/test/sitl): a real headless flight (connect, takeoff, move, land) per firmware/protocol. |

## Not covered yet

- **ROS 2 Lyrical (Ubuntu 26.04)**: not supported yet. At time of writing the `mavros` deb is not published for Lyrical and the scientific-Python stack lacks Python 3.14 wheels; the ROS/C++ layer and Gazebo build. Revisit when both land.
